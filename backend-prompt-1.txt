Role: Senior Go Backend Engineer

Task: Build a Go + MongoDB backend for an authentication and feedback system.

1. Core APIs to Implement:

POST /auth/request:

Accept an email.
* Generate a unique, time-limited token.
* Store in MongoDB with expires_at and is_used: false.
* Implement rate limiting (abuse prevention).
* Send an email via Resend SDK containing a deep link: rizon://login?token=UUID.
* This is an example code snippet 
    `package main

import (
    "log"

    "github.com/resend/resend-go/v2"
)

func main() {
    apiKey := "123456789"

    client := resend.NewClient(apiKey)

    params := &resend.SendEmailRequest{
        From:    "onboarding@resend.dev",
        To:      []string{"mahmud6799@gmail.com"},
        Subject: "Hello World",
        Html:    "<p>Congrats on sending your <strong>deep link: rizon://login?token=UUID</strong>!</p>",
    }

    sent, err := client.Emails.Send(params)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to send email: %v", err)
    }

    log.Printf("email sent: %s", sent.Id)
}

GET /auth/verify:

Validate the token. Ensure it is not expired and not used.
* Mark token as used.
* Generate and return a JWT for session persistence.

POST /feedback:
* Requirement: Must be attributable to the authenticated user via JWT middleware.
* Save feedback (text/rating) to MongoDB.
* Concurrency: Trigger the Slack Mock "Publish" call in a background goroutine so the API remains fast and reliable.

GET /user/status:
* Return whether the user has completed the onboarding flow.

2. Technical Constraints (Strict):

Slack Abstraction: Define a Notifier interface. Create a MockSlack struct that implements this interface by logging messages to the console.
* Race Conditions: Ensure the /feedback endpoint is idempotent to prevent duplicate submissions.
* Independence: The feedback business logic must call the Notifier interface, not the MockSlack directly, ensuring real integration can replace the mock later without refactoring.

3. Database: Use the official MongoDB Go Driver.
4. Framework: Use chi router for middleware support and resend-go for emails.
